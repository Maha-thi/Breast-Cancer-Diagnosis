# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis
Aim
To develop a breast cancer diagnosis system using machine learning models for accurate classification of malignant and benign tumors.

Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation. To address these challenges, this project implements a machine learning-based approach to classify breast cancer tumors based on clinical and diagnostic features.

This project utilizes two machine learning algorithms—Logistic Regression and Random Forest—to improve classification accuracy. The system is built using Python and Tkinter for an interactive GUI, making it user-friendly for medical practitioners and researchers.

Solution Proposed
The proposed solution automates breast cancer classification using machine learning models trained on a labeled dataset. Key steps include:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling features)
Model training using Logistic Regression and Random Forest
Building a GUI using Tkinter for easy user interaction
Predicting whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on user input
Tech Stack
Python (Data processing & ML implementation)
Scikit-learn (Machine learning models)
Tkinter (Graphical User Interface)
Pandas & NumPy (Data handling)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
Implementation
Dataset Preprocessing

Cleaning data (removing duplicates, handling missing values)
Feature scaling and selection
Model Training

Logistic Regression and Random Forest models are trained on the dataset
The models are saved using pickle for later use
Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development

Built using Tkinter
Allows users to input relevant clinical features and receive a prediction
Prediction and Output

The system classifies the tumor as Benign (Non-Cancerous) or Malignant (Cancerous)
Displays confidence scores of the predictions
